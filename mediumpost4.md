# Ten Reasons to Rethink Buying a Dog
1.	Its 7:00AM, still dark and freezing rain is falling from the sky and your dog whines persistently at you because he has to pee. You know you must get out of bed and brave the early morning and weather. You have the responsibility to go through the unpleasant parts of taking care of your pet to enjoy the pleasant times.
2.	You know that you want to go traveling but you know most hotels don’t allow pets, and the cost to fly your dog places with you is expensive and endangers his life. Depending on temperatures outside, your dog may not be allowed to fly that day causing you to need to reschedule a trip. Alternatively you think you can leave him with a sitter or at a kennel for the time you aren’t there, but that robs your pet of attention and affection he’s come to recognize and sometimes they don’t get the best care in other people’s hands.
3.	Before your dog you’d come home at night to clean floors, carpets, and furniture. Once you get a dog say goodbye to clean floors, carpets, and furniture. Fur will attach itself to everything in your house and you’ll find yourself cleaning up after your dog constantly whether it’s mud and dirt, the fact he peed on the white carpet for an umpteenth time, or because you neglected to come home in time to take him out and you found he’s pooped on your favorite chair.
4.	You find yourself struggling to stay afloat with your current financial situation but find yourself wanting a dog. You adopt one and suddenly you have extra expenses you didn’t have before like dry or wet dog food, veterinarian bills, cleaning and grooming products, and toys. You then in turn realize you can’t support your dog and yourself and turn it on the streets, or over to a shelter that will probably euthanize him if you aren’t selective of what shelter you give them to.
5.	You saw a puppy that was really cute and you practically died while gushing over their cuteness so you adopt it. After a few months he grows from a “puppers” to a “doggo” and you knew in the beginning the thought of an adult dog wasn’t as much an appealing idea as a cute little puppy so you neglect to give your dog the attention and love it deserves.
6.	You were bored and thought maybe a dog would spice up your life, and he does. He’s fun and playful and accompany you on hikes, walks, to the lake house or the park. But, they’re not only things to entertain you, dogs are living creatures that get sick, need vaccinations, a lot of exercise, and loved daily even if all you want is to be absolutely alone. Think of their needs first.
7.	You seem to work more than you’re home. You spend more time in the office than at home.
8.	Your significant other wants a dog really bad, but you do not. You think it’ll be easier to get one instead of fight about it. Dogs need cherishing and if you can’t welcome a dog with open arms, that’s not fair to him.
9.	Forget about crashing at your friend’s apartment, or staying out late on Saturday night enjoying a cocktail with a date. You need to be home in a timely fashions in order to take care of your dog.
10.	And finally, you sit at eyelevel with your dog, petting your his head softly and slowly. The harsh lights of the veterinarian’s office hurt your red eyes like looking directly into the sun. You stare into his chocolate eyes and move to hold his paw, grasping it tightly. You know it’s time to let go, but you can’t. You know this day will go down in history as one of the worst ones and you don’t handle death well. You know you’ll be crying for weeks afterwards and won’t be able to function during that time.
