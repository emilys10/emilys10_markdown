Medium Post Three: Ten Reasons Why Dogs Are Companions Not Just Pets
1.	When your parents are out of town and its 12AM. You lay in your bed listening to the rain storm raging outside. You have your TV volume up high because the eeriness of being alone in a house during a thunderstorm scratches the back of your head and tickles your spine. You look to your left and see your dog curled up next to you and suddenly you feel a little bit safer, a little bit more comfortable. You know he’ll protect you against all odds.
2.	It’s winter and snow covers the ground outside and frost builds up on the edges if your windowpanes. You’re under a mountain of blankets but still can’t seem to get warm enough. Good thing you have your own personal space heater in the form of your dog. You move closer to him and lay your hand on his side, feeling him breathe slowly.
3.	You can’t quite explain it but your dog seems to empathize and know when you’re feeling under the weather. He walks up to you with the saddest eyes you’ve ever seen and lays his head in your lap, trying to give you some solace. He licks your hand letting you know he’ll always be there for you and then cocks his to the side, looking you straight in the face as if he’s trying to say “it’s going to be alright, I love you.”
4.	You come home from a long day in school or maybe you’re home for a few weeks because your college has finally let you breathe for a minute before throwing you back into fast paced learning and stress. Your dog senses your arrival and runs as fast as his legs will let him toward the sound of your footsteps (the ones he’s memorized since he came to live with you). You hear his paws skid on the hardwood floors and you get down on your knees as he approaches you only to jump on top of you and lick your face. He’s panting because he’s been waiting for this moment for what feels like forever.
5.	You can’t quite put your finger on it but somehow your dog has better instincts about people than you do. Remember that significant other that cheated on you with your best friend at the time? Yeah, he didn’t like them from the start.
6.	Your dog seems to get the greatest joy out of the simplest things, like riding shot gun in the car with the window cracked half of the way down so he can just barely fit his nose out to feel the breeze. And somehow that inspires you. It inspires you to also find joy in things that may not be extravagant, but will always make you feel good.
7.	They’re up for anything, and I mean anything. An 8 mile hike? Your dog is down. A quick ride to the grocery store? Yes, he’s down. Dogs motivate you to get moving but also won’t make you feel guilty when you want to sit on your couch for an entire day binge watching House of Cards.
8.	 Your dog will always give you something to laugh and smile about every day. It’s a daily occurrence. Whether it’s simply laughing at his goofy smile as his tongue hangs to the side of his mouth, or the way he chases small chipmunks and squirrels in the backyard. Either way, you always seem to smile at least once a day because of him. Even on the worst days where you feel overwhelmed and like nothing is going your way.
9.	Dogs help people who have mental disorders such as depression or anxiety. They encourage people to socialize, open up, empathize, and always let you know you’re NEVER alone. They love unconditionally and that type of consistency is something that brings a lot of people comfort and confidence.
10.	And last but not least, Dogs are companion’s not just pets because every day is an adventure when you share your life with a dog.
